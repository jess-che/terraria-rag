The Hallowed armor enacts the Holy Protection buff which grants the player immunity to the next attack from enemies whereas Chlorophyte's set bonus acts as a sentry tower to fight for them. In case the player did not use the Hallowed armor, it might be advantageous to stick to Adamantite armor if they are a mage, and Frost armor if they prefer ranged or melee. The former's mana cost reduction bonus might prove more useful than the Leaf Crystal's extra damage depending on the weapon chosen, meanwhile, other stat bonuses of the sets are almost the same. As for the other two classes, Frost armor's Frostbite can prove to be a more reliable source of extra damage than the Crystal's shots, which can also be spread across multiple enemies. The Frost armor also offers a higher increase to damage and provides a bonus to melee attack speed.

If the character faces to the left, the path selected by The Grand Design will travel horizontally from the starting point, and then vertically to the cursor.

The Skeleton Sniper's weapon of choice follows this aesthetic: The weapon resembles a traditional bolt-action rifle with wood furnishing, such as the Karabiner 98k which was the standard-issue service rifle in Germany during WWII. The weapon may also be modeled after the FG 42, which was used by German paratroopers during WWII. The FG 42 was meant to be a replacement for a light machine gun, not a sniper rifle. However, a few were equipped with ZF4 scopes and used in a limited sniper role. The Skeleton Sniper also appears to wear a Stahlhelm, a helmet commonly used by the German military during both World Wars. The Skeleton Sniper will only occasionally drop a Rifle Scope, and it is not a guaranteed drop. This reflects the period during WWII when only a very small amount of semi-automatic and bolt-action rifles were equipped with scopes. The overwhelming majority of small arms in WWII were only fitted with iron sights, and very few actual snipers had the luxury of a scoped rifle. There were more marksmen and snipers than there were scopes. The Skeleton Sniper's weapon of choice follows this aesthetic: The weapon resembles a traditional bolt-action rifle with wood furnishing, such as the Karabiner 98k which was the standard-issue service rifle in Germany during WWII. The weapon may also be modeled after the FG 42, which was used by German paratroopers during WWII. The FG 42 was meant to be a replacement for a light machine gun, not a sniper rifle. However, a few were equipped with ZF4 scopes and used in a limited sniper role.

The Skeleton Sniper also appears to wear a Stahlhelm, a helmet commonly used by the German military during both World Wars. The Skeleton Sniper will only occasionally drop a Rifle Scope, and it is not a guaranteed drop. This reflects the period during WWII when only a very small amount of semi-automatic and bolt-action rifles were equipped with scopes. The overwhelming majority of small arms in WWII were only fitted with iron sights, and very few actual snipers had the luxury of a scoped rifle. There were more marksmen and snipers than there were scopes.",

It is still possible to build a town prior to defeating Skeletron, as the Dungeon Guardian will not spawn unless a player is actually inside the Dungeon (more specifically, when the player is in front of natural Dungeon Brick Walls ).

Later in the game, the player will not have to worry about accidentally triggering a battle with the Lunatic Cultist, as it is more likely they enter the Dungeon via their own entrance than the naturally-spawned one. Aside from the practical benefits, it also provides unique scenery for both the town and the Dungeon. This setup is not recommended in multiplayer games, where a player in the Dungeon can potentially cause Dungeon enemies to spawn within range to teleport to or attack players in the town. Alternately, building the Cavern Pylon at the top of the Underground layer near the player's main base may be convenient, especially in multiplayer or when all players have some form of Magic Mirrors. This allows the player to Hallow their base area without reshuffling pylons, if desired. A Dungeon town can then use the pylon of whatever surface biome it is located in, often Forest, allowing quicker access to the Ocean but still quick access to the Dungeon.

Aside from the practical benefits, it also provides unique scenery for both the town and the Dungeon. This setup is not recommended in multiplayer games, where a player in the Dungeon can potentially cause Dungeon enemies to spawn within range to teleport to or attack players in the town. Alternately, building the Cavern Pylon at the top of the Underground layer near the player's main base may be convenient, especially in multiplayer or when all players have some form of Magic Mirrors. This allows the player to Hallow their base area without reshuffling pylons, if desired. A Dungeon town can then use the pylon of whatever surface biome it is located in, often Forest, allowing quicker access to the Ocean but still quick access to the Dungeon. Another use for the Cavern Pylon is to put it in or near the Underworld, providing a viable alternative to a conventional Hellevator.",

Alternatively, this can also be done by maintaining the same horizontal position and marking the points above and below. In this case, the item will likely be to the left or right of the midpoint. This is easier with a Compass or a Depth Meter, as exact depths or latitudes for the midpoints can be calculated. The exact measurement is a horizontal radius of 85 tiles (170 feet) and a vertical radius of 60 tiles (120 feet).

However, gathering bait critters is fairly easy in the Forest, Jungle, or Hallow biomes. The options depend on biome and time of day. Rows of Mud Blocks with Jungle Grass Seeds on them can be used as a farm, as they will grow background plants which can be harvested for Jungle bait critters. Remember that a total of 8 Jungle bait critters can exist at a time. The spawn rates and spawn caps of critters are affected by many of the same factors as those of hostile enemies, hence Water Candles, Peace Candles (Desktop, Console and Mobile versions), Battle Potions, Calming Potions, and Sunflowers will affect critter spawns. As such, when attempting to farm critters, it is advised to use a Battle Potion and either hold or place a Water Candle nearby. In all cases, nearby NPCs improve the proportion of critters as compared to enemies. Provided enough are nearby, they can even suppress enemy spawns completely, which results in critters being the only creatures able to spawn. When in the Underworld or in Expert Mode (Desktop, Console and Mobile versions), enemies may still occasionally spawn, even when many NPCs are nearby. Flower Boots (Desktop, Console and Mobile versions) are an excellent means to farm bait. They work on all types of grass whose plants are suitable for spawning critters – regular, Jungle, and Hallowed. Bait can be farmed by running across a stretch of grass with Flower Boots on, then removing the boots and destroying the flowers.
